Recruitment Advertising
Today, job seekers rely on social networks to search and apply for jobs. To bring your positions 
in front of the people you want to hire, you have to go where they are. Posting jobs on social 
media platforms, or other more organic methods helps you increase the visibility of your job ads 
among potential candidates. 
PREPARING TO ADVERSTISE
A job advertisement is an announcement that informs people that a certain job position is 
available. It is written in an engaging tone, and it contains information not only about the job 
position but also about your agency and the benefits we offer. There are many advantages to 
advertised jobs, as they tend to be easy to find, offer a defined job role, and paints a clear
picture about what you are looking for in applicants. There are many steps agencies needs to 
make to make in their overall recruitment strategy before advertising their positions. 
• Determine your needs: First, decide what positions you need to fill. Do you anticipate 
receiving a high or low volume of applicants for that position? Gauge applicant volume 
by checking how many applicants that position has received in the past, asking 
recruiters who’ve recently recruited for a similar position what they experienced, and/or 
checking labor market trends.
• Discuss with management: Checking with your managers before posting an 
advertisement is wise as it ensures that all team members are on the same page. 
Discuss and plan how the position will be written and advertised.
• Consider budget: Analyze your budget for advertising. Advertising on a pricey job board 
can easily cost a couple of hundred dollars for a two-week posting. It’s important to be 
prepared and know that you have sufficient resources to find that perfect candidate.
WRITING AN EFFECTIVE JOB AD
Using your job description as a guideline, you can write an effective job ad that will yield strong, 
desirable candidates. Here are a few things you’ll need to include in your job ad:
• Job Description: Be sure to clearly explain the position and provide a list of role 
responsibilities. Sharing a lot of information in the ad without giving enough detail on the 
position can lead to unqualified candidates applying to your advertisement. Additionally, 
sharing minimal job responsibility data can lead to misunderstanding the ad narrative.
• About Us: Tell talent why they should work for your agency. What is the agency about? 
What is its mission? What is the workplace culture? Endear the reader to your brand and 
then dive into the description of the position you are recruiting for.
• Applicant Requirements: Add details to your job ad that list the Minimum Qualifications, 
Special Qualifications, and/or Desired Attributes.
• How to Apply: Your job ad should include instructions on how to apply via the State of 
Oregon job board, or better yet, include a direct link to the job posting on the State of 
Oregon job board.

PUBLISHING YOUR JOB ADVERTISEMENT
The top ways to recruit are using word of mouth (networking; employee referrals), posting to a 
job board and advertising on social media. Many job postings see most of their activity in the 
first week of advertising. Below are the various types of advertising which your agency will need 
to decide the platform most appropriate for the position.
When You Need to Hire Urgently:
Social Media Advertising: Agencies are authorized to use social media advertising to promote 
their positions on various platforms. Social media advertising, like other digital advertising, 
enables agencies to target specific audiences. They may focus on reaching customers based 
on their geographic location, job titles or skill sets. They can either pay for the platforms to 
promote their advertisements, or they can use more organic methods. Some of the most 
popular Social Media sites include Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
For example, an agency can use organic social media advertising by asking its followers to like 
and re-share one of their posts. Rather than full advertising campaigns, these methods may 
serve as more cost-effective techniques that enable the employer to spread awareness of their 
open roles.
Job Boards: Job boards are the best way for agencies and job seekers to find each other online. 
There are many to choose from, including general boards where any job might be posted, and 
narrowly focused niche boards that cater to specific industries and jobs. Below are the highest 
ranked boards that offer the most reach and give job seekers the best collection of professional 
opportunities.
 Indeed: Indeed is one of the best places to search for jobs. Ask people to name a job 
board and you'll get Indeed most of the time. What started off as a job search engine 
and job aggregator has become the biggest and most popular board worldwide.
 LinkedIn: LinkedIn is the world’s most popular social network for professionals. It's 
fast becoming a place to post jobs due to its enormous reach and growth in active 
users. LinkedIn mostly caters to professional jobs and senior roles. With the rise of 
social recruiting, LinkedIn fulfills a prominent role.
 ZipRecruiter: ZipRecruiter is a job board that allows employers to post jobs to 
hundreds of job boards, including ZipRecruiter itself. ZipRecruiter has gradually 
changed from an applicant tracking system into a job board that competes primarily 
with Indeed.
 CareerBuilder: CareerBuilder is a general posting site and is one of the most trusted 
and high-traffic job sites in the U.S. Job post pricing is based on the number of posts 
purchased. Bulk discounts are available.
 Dice: Dice is considered one the top Information Technology job boards in the US. 
This site caters specifically to IT talent and should be considered for hard to fill IT 
roles within your agency.

 Monster: Monster is a great job board for a wide range of jobs, and it features a 
helpful resume database. Pricing is based on the number of postings you buy — the 
more you buy, the cheaper each post. There is also a free plan without resume 
database access.
When You Have Time to Build a Pipeline:
Print Advertising: Print advertising refers to printed advertisements, often seen in newspapers 
and magazines. However, this category also includes other printed materials, such as 
brochures, directories and flyers that can be left in public spaces such as schools or authorized 
places of business. Agencies can place advertisements in local newspapers–whether 
throughout the paper or within the classifieds section—to target consumers within a geographic 
location.
Career Fairs: Jobseekers attend career fairs to interact with employers in meaningful ways. 
They want to learn things they cannot find out online. Interest in the agency is enhanced when 
the agency representatives take the time to connect on a personal level. The success of the 
career fair will depend on your display and literature that will be provided to interested 
candidates. Consider bringing giveaways along with plenty of brochures and business cards.
Some agencies have had success with hosting their own career fair. If you have a high volume 
of positions to fill or want to generate a pipeline of leads for future opportunities, consider 
hosting your own in-person or virtual event. 
FOLLOWING UP WITH YOUR AD
Finally, once you’ve published your job ad, follow up and review resumes promptly.
• Get to candidates quickly: When the market is hot, quickly following up and reviewing 
resumes is critical. Failing to review resumes on time can result in top talent no longer 
being available.
• Refresh your job postings: With some job boards, there is an option for “job refresh,” 
which ensures your posting stays toward the top of the first page of job search results. 
While your job posting is active, you should refresh it weekly.
• Stay in contact with candidates of interest: In addition to getting back to job seekers 
quickly for that first contact, be sure to connect regularly with your candidates of 
interest. A weekly call or email will reassure them that you value their time and the 
opportunity to include them on your team. 
• Boost your job postings: Many job posting sites will allow you to boost your job 
postings, which makes them visible to a larger audience for a determined amount of 
time.
• Check for Return on Investment: Run the Recruiting Source Effectiveness report in 
Workday to review where applicants heard about the position to determine if your 
advertising dollars were effective. Use this data to inform decisions about which 
sources to use for future recruitments.
